# Award-winning Project of NASA Space Apps 2024 Hackathon

## Awards

The project, developed by our Team EXO Sauce, won **Honorable Mention** and the **CAVES Cosmos Communicator** award in the local event of NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024.

The project was built using Unity, and this repository contains the source code used for the challenge.

## HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY
Our project presents an open-source application tailored for the observation of exoplanets with the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). It aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of these distant worlds. Through dynamic 3D visualizations of the cosmos, users can effortlessly explore exoplanet characteristics by manipulating various parameters with 5 different detector settings and 3 sizes of objective lens. The application empowers users to define befitting perspectives and instruments for their observations. Furthermore, it provides a precise depiction of exoplanet orientation, illustrating how these celestial bodies rotate in their orbits while maintaining a constant alignment towards their host star. On Earth, the application assesses the habitability of exoplanets using three distinct analytical layers; while in space, it elucidates the interplay between telescope parameters and observable exoplanets. This lightweight application encapsulates the essence of the universe, enabling users to carry a gateway to the galaxy in their pockets and engage in celestial exploration at anytime and anywhere.
